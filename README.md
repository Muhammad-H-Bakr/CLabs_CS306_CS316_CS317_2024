# C/C++ Labs : OS (C/ CS306)/ File Structure (C++/ CS316)/ Distribued Systems (C++/ CS317).
# In OS/DS you need a LINUX/UNIX Environment to run the codes.
# In DS you compile and run from the terminal. (mpic++ example.cpp -o test to compile mpiexec -n 4 ./test to run on 4 processors)
# In File Structure: Adjust the code from absolute location to your preference... Or you can just use "ofstream" to create file in CMake-debug-folder using relative location.
